## Characteristics of Treatment Groups

Below shows Table 1 for the baseline characteristics of the BCPP dataset. All proportions are calculated using this dataset (no exclusions). Then, we exclude any individuals who start the study HIV-infected, refused HIV testing, or had missing HIV testing. We calculate the proportions of the full dataset before removing those who are HIV-infected because they are still considered a cluster-level characteristic that will affect the HIV-uninfected individuals.

# DIRECTED ACYCLIC GRAPHS (DAGs)

This DAG shows both mediation pathways (i.e. pathways from treatment assignment, to actual treatment uptake, to outcome) as well as spillover (i.e. within-cluster spillover to a given individual, and between-cluster spillover to a given individual). The pathways are shown below.

## Misc. Notes

- Assume that there is no confounding or effect modification by anything including "village/cluster" and their sizes to start.
- For each of the above analyses, we can specify the causal assumptions needed for validity. It would be great to also identify the assumptions that are empirically verifiable or partially empirically verifiable.
- Once we've estimated the parameters and determined the assumptions needed for them to have a causal interpretation, and empirically verified those that we can, we can see if we have any new methodology or if this is an advanced application to existing methodology.





| Model Name | Model equation | Analytic sample | Extra covariates | What $\beta\_1$ estimates |
| ---------- | -------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| **SpW** | $\displaystyle \operatorname{logit}(Y_{ik})=\beta_0+\beta_1 T_k$ | Untreated Individuals | none | Total spillover for untreated people  |
| **SpWR** | $\displaystyle \operatorname{logit}(Y_{ik})=\beta_0+\beta_1T_k+\beta_2 Z_k^{(1)}$ | Untreated Individuals | village MC coverage | Remaining spillover after MC-coverage path is held fixed |
| **Ind** | $\displaystyle \operatorname{logit}(Y_{ik})=\beta_0+\beta_1 T_k+\beta_2 Z_k^{(1)}+\beta_3 Z_k^{(2)}$ | Males Only | village MC & HTC coverage | Assignment effect after measured spillover is held fixed (still contains own-uptake + unmeasured spillover) |
| **IndD** | $\displaystyle \operatorname{logit}(Y_{ik})=\beta_0+\beta_1 T_k+\beta_2X_{ik}^{(1)}+\beta_3 Z_k^{(1)}+\beta_4 Z_k^{(2)}$ | Males Only | own MC $X_{ik}^{(1)}$ + $Z$’s | Controlled-direct effect (paths via own MC **and** measured spillover blocked) |
| **Overall** | $\displaystyle \operatorname{logit}(Y_{ik})=\beta_0+\beta_1T_k$ | All HIV-negative participants | none | Total impact of CP village assignment (own uptake + *all* spillover) |



\newpage

And here's a proposal of how to maybe redo this so that the models are nested, and thus we can get valid results for important estimands such as "proportion of the total effect explained by spillover". 

Steps: 

1. Work on a single dataset (e.g. all HIV-negative participants at start of study)

2. Fit nested lgoistic models so that each new model adds only one class of pathways:

| Label   | Model equation  | $\beta_1$ contains  |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **A.  Total effect**             | $\displaystyle \operatorname{logit}\bigl(P(Y_{ik}=1)\bigr)=\beta_0+\beta_1T_k$                                                                                   | Own uptake + **all** spillover    |
| **B.  Minus own uptake**         | $\displaystyle \operatorname{logit}\bigl(P(Y_{ik}=1)\bigr)=\beta_0+\beta_1T_k+\beta_2X_{ik}^{(1)}+\beta_3X_{ik}^{(2)}$                                       | **All spillover**                 |
| **C.  Minus measured spillover** | $\displaystyle \operatorname{logit}\bigl(P(Y_{ik}=1)\bigr)=\beta_0+\beta_1T_k+\beta_2X_{ik}^{(1)}+\beta_3X_{ik}^{(2)}+\beta_4Z_k^{(1)}+\beta_5Z_k^{(2)}$ | Residual (*unmeasured*) spillover |


3. On the log-odds scale, the proportion of the total effect explained by spillover is then

$$\frac{\beta_1^A - \beta_1^B}{\beta_1^A}$$

4. All decompositions: 

    - Own uptake contribution is $\beta_1^A - \beta_1^B$
    - Measured spillover = $\beta_1^B - \beta_1^C$
    - Unmeasured spillover = $\beta_1^C$
    - These three pieces add up exactly: $\beta_1^A = (\beta_1^A - \beta_1^B) + (\beta_1^B - \beta_1^C) + \beta_1^C$



All quantities come from the same population, so the algebra and interpretation is valid.
